    <h6>The new aproching of game engines!</h6>
</div>

### 📀 What is the project all about?
A new aproching in game engine, a strange way of trying new mathematical aspects, including the few alredy planned :
  * Raytracing and marching
  * Correct Physic Model Simulations for Rigid and Softy Body
  * Great framework for doing hard physics on it, like mathlab graphics and data viewing tools
  
<br>

## 💻 And what about the technologies?
There is on use the OpenGL 4.2, on glad implementation, applied with glfw and ImGui

<br>
